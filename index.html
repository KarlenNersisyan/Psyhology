        <h2>What Is Psychology?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          As a broad definition, psychology is the study of behavior and the
          mind. The overall scholarly discipline of psychology can be divided
          into many different specializations, with the most prominent being the
          following:
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Clinical — Applying the science and theory of psychology to treat
            mental illness and disabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cognitive — Studying internal mental processes to understand how
            individuals think, learn, and communicate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Developmental — Researching how the human mind develops over the
            course of an individual’s life.
          </li>
          <li>
            Forensic — Applying psychology to investigate criminal behaviors.

        <h2>The History of Psychology</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Although psychology is now a rather distinguished scientific
          discipline, it has surprisingly humble roots. Psychology only became
          classified as a true academic discipline in 1875, when Professor
          William James established the first formal psychology course in the
          United States at Harvard University. Soon after, in 1878, G. Stanley
          Hall became the first American to earn a doctoral degree in
          psychology. Then, Wilhelm Wundt established the first experimental
          psychology lab in 1879 in Germany, and psychology became studied on an
          international scale. Before this, psychology was viewed academically
          as mental philosophy, rather than as its own laboratory science. By
          1892, Hall had enough colleagues to establish the American
          Psychological Association, a professional organization meant to
          facilitate interactions among American psychologists.

        <h2>What Does the Future of Psychology Look Like?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Thought leaders in psychology expect neuroscience and molecular
          biology to become far more important to clinical psychology. While
          today’s psychological research may involve using neuroimaging
          technology to observe the brain as it processes thoughts, this
          technology has not nearly reached its full potential. Though it is
          unclear exactly what benefit these tools will provide, the future of
          psychology will likely feature the discovery of more practical
          applications for neuroimaging equipment in the field of psychology,
          such as using neuroimaging to gain a better understanding of cognitive
          disorders.
